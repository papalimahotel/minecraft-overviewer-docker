This docker image provides an NGiNX server that hosts maps of your Minecraft world.  The zoomable/dragable maps are generated by [Overviewer](https://overviewer.org/).  By default once an hour the content is re-rendered.

## Usage
The simplest usage is

	docker run -d -p 80:80 -v /opt/minecraft/world:/mc/world papalimahotel/minecraft-overviewer

where _/opt/minecraft/world_ is the world folder on your host machine.

## Customization

#### Render Cycle
By default the render cycle is once an hour (3600 seconds).  By setting the **OVERVIEWER_CYCLE** environment variable you can adjust the render time.  To set the cycle to every 4 hours use

	docker run -d -p80:80 -v /opt/minecraft/world:/mc/world -e OVERVIEWER_CYCLE=14400 papalimahotel/minecraft-overviewer

The value is the length of the cycle in seconds.

#### World Name
By default overviewer displays a world name of 'myworld'.  You can change this by setting the **OVERVIEWER_WORLD_NAME** environment variable.  Here is an example of the command with a world name set

	docker run -d -p80:80 -v /opt/minecraft/world:/mc/world -e OVERVIEWER_WORLD_NAME="Alderaan" papalimahotel/minecraft-overviewer

#### Textures
There is a volume _/ov_ that is available in the image. Inside that volume there is a texture folder that a resource pack can be placed in to customize the map's rendered image.  ***Note***: The resource pack __**must**__ be for the same version of Minecraft as your world.

#### Overviewer Configuration
Also in the _/ov_ volume is a config subfolder that contains the config.py file.  This file is the configuration specification for the Overviewer render options.
